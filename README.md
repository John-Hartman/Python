Small bits of code to learn python
The end goal is to make an app that will "randomly" generate a response to choose what to make for dinner on any given night.
I created a small bit of code with the use of random.choices but the code still prints out extra text that I do not want.
Eventually I would like to have a way for users to add new dinner items without the know how of changing the code.
